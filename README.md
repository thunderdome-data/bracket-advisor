Calculates the win probability for two teams selected using zero to eight stats selected and sorted by the user.
	
This iteration is for NCAA tournament. The format could be used for any bracketed sports playoff.
	
##The flow of code
On load, data is loaded from four csv files, the lefthand sortable stats are built dynamically (in specified order if from the URL), the two select menus of teams are dynamically generated (from ncaa_teams.csv) and the leaderboard is generated (from top_matchups.csv and top_teams.csv)

Users can sort and select/deselect stats to be used in the calculation, and  select two teams from the dropdown menu. Once they hit the "Go" button, the selection is recorded in a DB table, the teams' info modules are populated and the percentage with is calculated. Similarly, whenever a stat is selected, deselected or sorted, the percent win is recalculated.

There is also a button to post your matchup (with stat selection) on Twitter.

##What's in here?

* ``app.html``
* ``holds html``
* ``js/cinderella.js`` - loads data from CSVs; builds team data module, team select menus and left stats sorting module; performs button actions and calculates win percentages.
* ``incl/leaderboard.php`` - captures user's team selections in tables ``sports.ncaa_topmatchups`` and ``sports.ncaa_topteams`` for use in generating leaderboard.
* ``csvoutput.php`` - generates two csv files (``data/top_matchups.csv`` and ``data/top_teams.csv``) at 15-minute intervals from production database for use in the leaderboard. The csvs are generated on beta and then rsynced to production in a cron job.
* ``makepercentages.php`` - generates the stats used to calculate the percentage win for the teams selected. The data is drawn from ``sports.ncaa_data`` (historical data) and ``sports.ncaa_teams`` (current team stats), the calculations are performed and then the percentages are inserted into ``sports.ncaa_percentages``. ``sports.ncaa_percentages`` and ``sports.ncaa_teams`` are exported as .csv files (``data/ncaa_percs.csv`` and ``data/ncaa_teams``).
	
The data files: 
* ``data/ncaa_percs.csv`` - used in win percent calculations
* ``data/ncaa_teams.csv`` - hold's teams' info, names and stats
* ``data/top_matchups.csv`` - for leaderboard, has top 5 matchups selected
* ``data/top_teams.csv`` - for leaderboard, has top 10 teams selected


## Possible features for future iterations
	
* Add click event tracking code from Google Analytics
* Link top teams list to twitter accounts: Link Leaderboard Top Teams to their Twitter accounts, pop up in new window.
* Should we flag eliminated teams in dropdowns: As teams get eliminated, flag them with an image or with bgcolor in the dropdown menus.
* Add a custom URL share button in addition to the twitter share. A button that would generate the share button URL without dependency on Twitter. just the URL: http://www.bracketadvisor.com/?t1=3&t2=5&stats=a6-a2-a3-a4
